Voice Insight & Feedback Platform – Technical Blueprint
Overview
This document outlines the technical blueprint for building a secure, EU-based platform that leverages local LLMs and voice recognition to provide real-time transcription, speaker identification, fact-checking, and personalized feedback.
Target use case: A voice-enabled tool that records audio (via Omi), identifies the speaker, transcribes the text, stores it securely, and analyzes the statements for factual accuracy and process alignment using private company data.

Feature List
Core Features
Audio Capture (via Omi)
Records high-quality audio from user
Sends to backend for processing
Transcription (Whisper / Riva)
Converts speech to text
Supports multiple languages (English, Dutch, etc.)
Speaker Diarization
Detects "who spoke when"
Handles up to 5 speakers with high accuracy
Speaker Identification (Optional)
Matches voice to known user profiles
Uses embeddings + ECAPA-TDNN or SpeechBrain
Fact Checking Engine
Analyzes statements against proprietary company data
Flags incorrect, unsupported, or misleading statements
Feedback Reports
Generates summaries per session
Shows accuracy stats, highlights corrections, and tracks performance over time
Secure EU-based Storage & Hosting
GDPR-compliant
Runs entirely within EU infrastructure (Hetzner, Clever Cloud, Scaleway, Azure EU)
Local LLMs for Analysis
Runs Mistral 7B, Phi-3, or Mixtral locally via Ollama or vLLM
Avoids reliance on US cloud services
API Endpoints
Upload audio
Request analysis
Retrieve feedback
Generate weekly/monthly reports

Limitations
Real-time Processing
Whisper and most diarization models are not fully real-time
Latency per step:
Transcription: ~3–10 seconds
Speaker Diarization: ~5–15 seconds
LLM Analysis: ~5–30 seconds (depends on model and data size)
Speaker Recognition
Requires clean, high-quality audio
Speaker ID requires pre-recorded voice profiles (~30–60 seconds training data)
Accuracy drops with >5 speakers or overlapping speech
Fact-checking Accuracy
Based entirely on your internal data (no global knowledge)
If data is missing, LLM can’t validate facts properly
Context limit (~4k–8k tokens) in local LLMs can reduce performance for long transcripts

Hardware Requirements
Whisper/Riva: GPU recommended for fast transcription
LLMs:
Mistral 7B Q4: ~8–16GB VRAM
Phi-3 Mini: ~4–8GB RAM (CPU-friendly)
vLLM/Ollama server: 24+ GB RAM, CUDA GPU preferred

Security & Compliance
🔐 Data stays in the EU (GDPR-compliant hosting)
🔒 Encrypted storage & transmission (TLS, AES-256)
🧾 Audit logs & user access tracking
🧠 No use of OpenAI / Google APIs for inference
✅ User consent required for speaker profiling

Feasibility Validation (Research Summary)
Local LLMs for Audio
Whisper + local LLMs (e.g. Mistral 7B) are used in production-like pipelines with acceptable latency (~0.5s to first token)
Open-source platforms confirm successful pipelines with Ollama and vLLM for audio-derived summarization and analysis
Audio-native LLMs like Kimi-Audio show promise, but require large compute and are early-stage
Speaker Diarization & Identification
pyannote-audio is a state-of-the-art tool for diarization, widely used and actively maintained
Real-world benchmarks show Diarization Error Rates (DER) of ~12–20% depending on noise, overlap, and audio quality
Speaker identification using embeddings (ECAPA-TDNN, resemblyzer, SpeechBrain) works well with >30s of reference audio
Overlapping speakers and poor-quality audio remain challenges; newer hybrid EEND models are improving this space

Summary
This system enables users to record spoken statements, analyze them against internal truth sources, and receive real-time or near-real-time feedback on their factual accuracy. It uses local LLMs and secure infrastructure to ensure privacy, performance, and compliance in a European business context.
Optional: Add dashboard, Slack integration, or export reports (PDF/CSV/JSON).
