    "subheadline": "Everything you need to know about Brutally Honest.",
    "questions": {
      "privacy": {
        "q": "How does Brutally Honest ensure my data stays private?",
        "a": "All AI processing happens locally on your hardware using Ollama and local Whisper models. Your audio, transcriptions, and analysis never leave your server. We don't use cloud APIs like OpenAI or Google—everything runs on your machine. This is fundamental to our architecture, not just a feature."
      },
      "truthExtraction": {
        "q": "What does 'truth extraction' actually mean?",
        "a": "Truth extraction is our process of analyzing conversations to identify: (1) Factual claims that can be verified against your knowledge base, (2) Inconsistencies between what someone says now vs. what they've said before, (3) Gaps between stated intentions and documented actions, and (4) Linguistic patterns that indicate uncertainty or deception. It's not mind-reading—it's systematic verification."
      },
      "hardware": {
        "q": "What hardware do I need to run this?",
        "a": "For optimal performance, we recommend an NVIDIA GPU with at least 8GB VRAM (RTX 3060 or better). The system also runs on NVIDIA Jetson devices, Apple Silicon Macs, and CPU-only setups (slower). Minimum: 16GB RAM, 50GB storage. We provide setup guides for all configurations."
      },
      "consent": {
        "q": "Can I use this for recording meetings without consent?",
        "a": "We strongly advise checking your local laws regarding recording consent. Many jurisdictions require all-party consent. Brutally Honest is designed for legitimate use cases like: interview analysis (with consent), reviewing your own recorded meetings, processing uploaded audio you have rights to, and research purposes with proper ethics approval."
      },
      "accuracy": {
        "q": "How accurate is the fact-checking?",
        "a": "Accuracy depends on your knowledge base quality. The AI cross-references claims against documents you've uploaded—contracts, reports, emails, company policies. It's only as good as your reference material. We recommend building comprehensive knowledge bases for each use case. The system also flags confidence levels so you know when to verify manually."
      },
      "humanJudgment": {
        "q": "Is this replacing human judgment?",
        "a": "No. Brutally Honest is an augmentation tool. It surfaces information that's easy to miss in the flow of conversation. A claim flagged as 'inconsistent' should trigger your own investigation—the AI provides leads, not verdicts. Think of it as a highly attentive assistant that never forgets what was said."
      },
      "export": {
        "q": "Can I export the analysis results?",
        "a": "Yes. Export to JSON, PDF reports, or integrate via API. The Professional and Enterprise plans include comprehensive reporting with timestamped claims, source references, and credibility scores. All data remains on your server."
      },
      "difference": {
        "q": "How is this different from regular transcription services?",
        "a": "Standard transcription just converts speech to text. Brutally Honest adds: real-time claim extraction, cross-referencing against your knowledge base, inconsistency detection across multiple conversations, speaker profiling, mission/vision alignment scoring, and trend analysis. It's the difference between a transcript and an intelligence report."
